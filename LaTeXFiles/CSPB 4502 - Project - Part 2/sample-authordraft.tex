\section{Problem Statement/motivation}
Our project focuses on analyzing data related to COVID-19, including the effect of vaccination on transmission, hospitalization, and death. We will also look at other local variables, such as elevation, temperature, humidity, and population density to track the spread of the virus. Our analysis will also use geospatial analysis to look for hot spots and infection surges to see how surrounding counties are impacted. We are relying on the \href{https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/}{COVID-19 Open Data by Google}, which provides differing levels of granularity to allow us to focus on different analyses, providing data from 1/1/2020 to 9/17/2022 of various scopes, from world-wide aggregate data, to data about any individual county in a state in the US. This data was compiled by researchers who authored a paper called \textit{COVID-19 Open-Data a global-scale spatially granular meta-dataset for coronavirus disease} \cite{wahltinez2022covid}.\\ \\
Our motivation is multifaceted. First, COVID-19 is a unique event in our lifetime that impacted the world in an unprecedented way. The urgency of finding a solution to the pandemic resulted in a large amount of data being collected, which makes it a good topic for a data mining project. 
\cite{wahltinez2022covid}. \\

The intriguing questions we aim to answer are:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item How are COVID rates correlated with local variables such as: \begin{enumerate}
        \item Temperature % maybe use a 2 week moving avg of temp & 1-week new COVID cases
        \item Elevation % since elevation is static, we would want to look at cumulative cases
        \item Humidity % maybe 2 week moving avg
        \item Population density %maybe , affect COVID rates? 
        \item Age % Are older individuals more susceptible to mortality?
        \item Sex %Investigating whether sex has any influence on COVID-19 outcomes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Using geospatial data to identify hot spots or areas experiencing a surge, and examining from that the effect on surrounding areas over time.

\section{Literature survey}
A broad range of prior work has been performed on this data due to significant global impact of COVID-19 on society in the past four years. This data has been applied to economic impact analysis, public health policy analysis, modeling the spread of the virus, assessment of containment measure success and failure, health and healthcare impact forecasts, and more. This dataset has informed researchers, scientists, and healthcare workers in numerous facets of their efforts to effectively allocate resources for vaccine distribution and information dissemination to combat the spread of COVID-19. Fuchs, A. et al \cite{fuchs2020mask} used the dataset to analyse China’s exports of medical goods in times of COVID-19. Arpino, B., et al \cite{arpino2020no} used the data to show that available evidence on the link between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 is inconclusive. While Murrell, H. et al \cite{murrell2020estimating} used the data to to estimate Rt from Covid-19 data, using SIR models. Studying how infection or vaccination triggers both cellular and humoral responses is essential to know the grade and length of protection generated in the population.

\section{Data set}

The COVID-19 Open Data can be downloaded as world-wide aggregate data, but the data for some countries was sparse in comparison to the US data by county, which was more reliably reported in this dataset. As such, while we plan to clean our data to account for missing values or sparse data, we believe a stronger foundation in the US data by county presents a better baseline dataset for purposes of data mining in this class. As such, we downloaded each US state by county, for a total of 3,228 CSV files with 991 rows of data each on average, and we are storing that in our group GitHub. COVID-19 Open Data is most comprehensive COVID-19 dataset we are aware of. It contains collection of epidemiological metrics, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and tests, with variability in data availability across different regions. It highlights the differentiation between new and cumulative data to accommodate adjustments in counting criteria and corrections.

\section{Proposed Work}

\begin{comment}
    - classification: hot spots/zones for mortality, infection, death
    - geographical analysis: (need to pull in geospatial data) of the spread (potentially from areas identified as hot spots or areas that had recent high infection)
    - correlation: between temperature, humidity, etc
\end{comment}

\textbf{Data Transformation}: The data will undergo normalization to incorporate population size, allowing for a more accurate assessment of rates related to high cases, death rates, and vaccination rates. Different normalization methods will be implemented to evaluate their effect on the data such as logarithmic scaling to linearize the data, min-max scaling, population density, and z-score standardization.Below are some considered formulas.
\begin{align*}
\text{Min-Max Scaling:} \quad x_i' &= \frac{{x_i - x_{\text{min}}}}{{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}} \\
\text{Z-score Standardization:} \quad z_i &= \frac{{x_i - \mu}}{{\sigma}} \\
\text{Logarithmic scaling:} \quad x_i' &= \log(x_i) \\
\end{align*}

%I am intresting in linearizing the data because infection rates grow exponentially it might show a better picture of rate of change. 
\
\textbf{Data Repositories}: Currently we maintain a primary repository file where the files remain static, located at "add URL for all CVS." Additionally, there's a designated section named "add URL for test" to facilitate experimentation without altering the original dataset.\\
\textbf{Data Reduction}: The dataset primarily focuses on values relevant to the United States due to the abundance of available data. Furthermore, concerns arise regarding the consistency and reliability of data across different countries due to limitations in resources for tracking cases and deaths. Additionally, the dataset exhibits high dimensionality, prompting the need for a dimension reduction analysis to extract dimensions of interest. Lastly, repeated elements conveying identical information will be consolidated to further diminish the dataset's size.\\
\textbf{Data Cleaning}: Our data will undergo meticulous checks to ensure consistency in data types. While our dataset is fortunate to be rich in quality, we will still thoroughly review it for any inconsistencies or anomalies to maintain its integrity. \\
\textbf{Data Aggregation}: The data will be presented in weekly,monthly, and yearly intervals,showcasing the progression of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. Geographically the data will split into counties or states to see how the virus was handles by each respective group.\\ 
\textbf{Data Integration}: This is a rich data set and at this point in our analysis we feel we do not need to perform data integration. \\
\textbf{Regression models}: Linear regression models will be used to help predict transmission rates/mortality rates with regards to a variables such as population density, temperature, humidity, and interventions like vaccination. By fitting a regression line to historical data. \\
\textbf{Logarithmic plot}: Do to the nature of virus growing exponentially a logarithmic plot will linearize the data which may help in trends and growth rates. \\
\textbf{Scatter plot}: This particular plotting method is useful in identifying correlations among variables. \\
\textbf{Geographical analysis}: We will leverage Geopandas to investigate visual hotspots/zones related to mortality, infection, and fatality. Additionally, we can potentially employ this tool for clustering analysis. \\ 
\textbf{Previous literature}: The profound impact of COVID-19 on the world occurred during an era characterized by widespread access to information, leading to extensive research efforts due to its global significance. As a result, many of the data analysis techniques utilized in our study have already been used to some extents in previous research papers. Despite the similarities in techniques used in previous literature, our dataset appears to have been underutilized in comparison. As a result, there may be differences between our findings and those of other studies, or it is possible that we have independently arrived at similar conclusions through our own analyses. 

\section{Evaluation Methods}
Our group is expecting to measure our success based on our ability to answer the interesting questions set forth here and revised based on our exploration of the data throughout the semester. Objective and subjective evaluation methods will be used for this. As we have seen in the lecture slides, strong association rules are sometimes misleading and we have to use our objective judgment to evaluate the data. Additionally, we will conduct comparative analyses with previous findings, as COVID-19 has been extensively studied. This comparison will allow us to assess the consistency of our results with existing literature and contribute to the broader understanding of the virus's impact.


\section{Tools}
Python Programming language with data science libraries will be used in this project. Python is easy to use and supports wide variety of data science libraries. In addition, Python has a large community which publish tutorials and provides support in online forums.
The following supportive tools will be used in the project. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Overleaf} for drafting of our project proposal and presentation(s) to allow for real-time collaboration and updates.
\item \textbf{Git/GitHub} for version control and collaboration.
\item \textbf{Pandas} for manipulating numerical tables and time series as it provides high level abstraction and supports a wide variety of data types.
\item \textbf{NumPy} for simple multi-dimensional arrays and matrices mathematical operations.
\item For data visualization we are considering: \textbf{Tableau, Plotly} and \textbf{Matplotlib}. Tableau and Plotly are interactive, easy to share, and provide high level graphics. While, Matplotlib is flexible and open source. 
\item \textbf{Geopandas} A choropleth map can be utilized to provide a geographic visualization of virus trends.k

\end{itemize}
